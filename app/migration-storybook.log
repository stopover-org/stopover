=> Applying mdx-to-csf: 20 files
The codemod was not able to transform the files mentioned above. We have renamed the files to .mdx.broken. Please check the files and rename them back to .mdx after you have either manually transformed them to mdx + csf or fixed the issues so that the codemod can transform them.
The migration successfully updated your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.

It also ran the 'mdx-to-csf' codemod to convert your MDX stories to CSF format.
This codemod is not perfect however, so you may need to manually fix any issues it couldn't handle.
